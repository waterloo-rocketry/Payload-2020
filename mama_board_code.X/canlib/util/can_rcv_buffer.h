/*
 * A module for buffering CAN messages that are received from the CAN module.
 * The module operates as a ring buffer, with the memory provided by the caller
 * of the module.
 *
 * The whole goal of this module is allowing you to write application code that
 * doesn't have to concern itself with ISR vs main thread code. If you set
 * buffer_received_can_message as the can callback, then you can dequeue the
 * buffered messages from the main thread without worrying about missing any
 * messages from the bus.
 *
 * The ring buffer is designed to be pseudo-thread safe. None of the functions
 * are rentrant, and there are no locking or atomic mechanisms, but flags are
 * used to show whether a particular memory element contains valid data. This
 * should allow the writer function (buffer_received_can_message) and the reader
 * function (get_buffered_can_message) to operate from separate contexts (the
 * former can be run in the ISR and the latter in the main thread) without any
 * problems.
