/*
 * Magic numbers: timer is driven on a 500kHz clock and is 8 bits.
 * Timer rolls over every 256 counts, or every 512 microseconds.
 * MILLIS_INCREMENT = 0, since there are 0 ms added each rollover
 * MILLIS_REMAINDER = 512, added each time the timer is triggered
 * MILLIS_INCREMENT_CAP = 1000, number of microseconds before we tick over a millisecond
 * 
 * Only the ratio between MILLIS_REMAINDER and MILLIS_INCREMENT_CAP matters, so
 * we can optimize things a little bit by dividing both by 8 so that the largest
 * value of internal_count can fit within 8 bits.
