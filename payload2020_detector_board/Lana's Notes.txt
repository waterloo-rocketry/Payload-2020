Lana's Notes of Confusion:
1. This needs to amplify radiation of unknown amounts to between 0-5V
	I do not know how much radiation, or what kind we're expecting.
2. The photodiode measures it's input interms of Iux, which is only applicable to visible light.
	I have no idea how to measure what kind of current output we are going to receive from 
	energy sources that can't me measured in Iux. 

Lana's Note of Hope:
1. The op amp will not amplify anything above 5V, so seems to me, to be no harm in
   just way overamplifying because that way we won't miss anything.
	
   The only problem with that is that we might read noise as input. 


ALRIGHT THANKS FOR YOUR TIME and I'm really sorry
